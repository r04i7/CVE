:

    Vendor: Sourcecodester
    Product: Laboratory Management System
    Product URL: https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/17268/computer-laboratory-management-system-using-php-and-mysql.html

Executive Summary

Laboratory Management System provides the facility to add Borrowing. It has been observed that the input taken from user is not properly sanitized. This allows the attacker to inject the malicious JavaScript code in the “Borrower Name” input field.
